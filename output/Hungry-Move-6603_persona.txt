**Quote:** "Malls are a thing of the past - and entire LKO is on steroids in rents cost, despite low to no demand."

**Bio / Background:** Rohan is a businessman who recently relocated from Delhi to Lucknow (LKO) in December 2024. He appears to be relatively new to the city and is actively trying to adjust to its culture and lifestyle.  He's observant and critical, often voicing his opinions on various aspects of Lucknow's society and infrastructure.

**Goals:**  To establish his business successfully in Lucknow. To find reliable and high-quality services (like tiffin services) in his new city. To understand and navigate the social dynamics of Lucknow.  To find productive activities to engage in during weekends.

**Frustrations:**  High rents in Lucknow despite low demand, the prevalence of bribery and corruption (especially amongst police), the quality of food from tiffin services, the seemingly ubiquitous stickers on cars indicating various affiliations,  the harassment he or others experience, and generally adjusting to life in a new city.
